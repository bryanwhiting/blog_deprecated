      <description>Here are some notes on machine learning models.
Concepts Behind Decision Trees  Bagging (boostrap aggregation): Randomly sample with replacement, and average the results. Majority vote: The most commonly-occuring prediction. Internal node: Where the splits occur. Branches: Segments that connect the nodes. Terminal node (leafs, regions): Where the observations end up. The average of the responses (or majority vote) is the prediction for future observations. Gini index: where \(m\) is the leaf and \(k\) is the class (0 or 1 for binary classification, but can be extedned for multiple classes).</description>

      <title>Collect, Analyze, and Map Addresses in R</title>

      <description>The goal of this tutorial is to do the following:
Collect addresses (via Google Forms) Download to R (via googlesheets) Geocode them (via geocode) Plot them (using leaflet) Get driving distance between them (via gmapsdistance) Cluster them (kmeans) Making the leaflet plot fancy  1. Collect Perhaps in a future post Iâ€™ll explore googleformr. For now, I create forms the old-school way.</description>
