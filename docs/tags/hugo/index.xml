      <description>The beauty of open source is “Oh, let me just download that package and I can do amazing things!”. The reality is “ok, I downloaded it, and I got the ‘hello world’ example working. But now to actually get it to do what I want in the environment that I want takes like…now 30 hours? Just one more bug and I’ll finally give up…”
Bugs I hit: I hit a lot of bugs when building my Leaflet tutorial.</description>

Why Hugo? One of my first posts was about blogging with Jekyll hosted on GitHub. About six months after writing that post, I hit a few bugs trying to debug it and got frustrated because I had already forgotten all of what I binge-learned earlier.</description>
