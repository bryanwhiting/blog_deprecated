      <description>Last March, I wanted to break into the Data Science community but was struggling with confidence and starting to doubt I&amp;rsquo;d make it. I had been reading blog after blog about data science, practiced additional coding and learning new methods at night. And rejection after rejection, I wondered if I was on the right path. Now on the other side, hindsight is 20&amp;frasl;20.
I write this post to my past self, a person seeking for a job they couldn&amp;rsquo;t seem to get.</description>
