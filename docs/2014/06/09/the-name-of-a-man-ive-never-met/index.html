      <p>This is Wallsberg. It’s a beautiful town tucked away where my Grandfather purchased a plot of land in the 1970’s. I’ve driven past the exit to this little town of 300 people at least a hundred times on the commute from Provo to Park City, Utah. But three weeks ago, as I was going to a friend’s house, I decided to stop by and see what belonged to my family.</p>

<p>My uncle who lives nearby has been helping to manage the property. I gave him a call to see where exactly my family’s property stood, and he began guiding me over the phone through where I was supposed to go. As I pulled up the driveway, removed the rusted fence, and drove up the small hill, the property began to unfold itself. One hundred acres of lush pasture came into view as I navigated the narrow dirt tracks around the hill to the back side of the property. Cattle grazed the grass fields as a few large trees splotched the land with shade. It was beautiful.</p>

<p>My uncle continued to guide me around the property to an old A-frame house. “That’s where Dad would stay when he came up to work on the ranch,” he said. It didn’t look like much of a place for a family, and it wasn’t, but it looked like a comfortable place for someone to stay.</p>

</div>
<p>After I thanked my uncle and hung up the phone, I sat in my car to think for a little bit. I felt a lot of peace, really. I never met my Grandpa. He passed away on April 17, 1983 just a few years after he purchased his ranch and I wasn’t born until 1990. But to see the fence he built, the land he mulled, the A-frame he slept in - it helped build the identity of a man I’ve never met, and the stories I had heard about him started to feel more real. It was comforting.</p>
<p>I wondered why I felt peace in a place I’d never been to and a place I perhaps didn’t belong to. By all appearances, to this foreign town and foreign property, which I had never before visited, I was a trespasser. But I felt like I belonged, I felt comfortable. And as I thought about it, I did belong there. I belonged there because my family owns the property. Because I share my Grandpa’s name, and it was his property, I belonged in Wallsberg.</p>
<p>And then I thought, likewise, when I die, there’s a place prepared for me. We all have a Heavenly Father, or God, that has prepared a heaven for us. And just like Wallsberg, I can belong there if I take upon me the name of Christ. The Apostle Peter taught, “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved,” (Acts 4:12). We can attain salvation, which is living in heaven, if we have Christ’s name with us. So how can we take upon us the name of Christ?</p>
<p>The prophet Nephi taught that to take Christ’s name upon us, it’s important to follow Jesus Christ, “…with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism…” (2 Nephi 31:13). So through baptism, we take upon us the name of Christ, and through following His example the rest of our lives, we retain His name.</p>
<p>Although I’ve never met my Grandpa in this life, I enjoyed being able to walk where he walked, to sit and think where he sat and thought. It taught me about who he is. I felt a desire to be like him. The same applies to my relationship with Jesus Christ. Because He walked this earth thousands of years ago, I’ve never met Him. But I can learn about Him in the same way I learned about my Grandpa - by doing what He did and thinking about life in the same way He would. And if I take His name upon me through baptism, I can be a rightful heir of heaven.</p>
<p>It was good to visit with a man I’ve never met.</p>
