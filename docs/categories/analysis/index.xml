      <description>In Part 1, I modeled births at the year level, which didn’t seem to have much seasonality. Now I’m going to try to model the monthly birth rates in the US.
Predicting Seasonality I hit up the UN data to get seasonal birthrates, which I couldn’t find at CDC. Unfortunately, the UN data doesn’t have a long range of data.</description>

      <description>I’m still excited to be a dad, so I’m going to try to model birth rates in the US. This will be a time series modeling exercise, and I’ll use this time to explore some modeling techniques. In Part 2 I’ll model the monthly birth rates.
I downloaded CDC birth data from here: * https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/natality-trends/ * “Births and General Fertility Rates” &amp;gt; Download CSV * Other data sets can be found here: https://www.</description>

      <description>I’ve taken a particular interest in names since I’m thinking of a name for my to-be-born son. I did a little digging through the Social Security Administration names database, which lists all names given to baby boys and girls in America1. I began this exercise to just get a quality list of ideas, but my curiosity got the better of me.
Name Trends Since 1950 What was the most popular boy name since 1950?</description>

      <description>Goal of this post. Answer some interesting questions about BYU football. Dive into different modeling approaches. I don’t explain my thinking below, but some of the charts might be cool.
Some questions of interest
 How is Kilani Sitake doing in his second season compared to past BYU coaches? More challenging: how’s he doing relative to all second-season coaches?  df_in &amp;lt;- read.csv(file.path(fp_data, &amp;#39;byu_seasons.csv&amp;#39;)) %&amp;gt;% distinct() Some basic questions: * How many years do we have data on?</description>

      <description>So you want to buy a car, but you don’t know anything about them? Welcome to my life.
You show up at the dealer and there’s a sticker on the window. You know the difference between make and model, but you soon learn what a trim is. Some versions come with leather. Some have a sun roof. Some have all wheel drive. Some have 20k in miles, and a similarly priced car in a higher trim is at 40k miles.</description>
