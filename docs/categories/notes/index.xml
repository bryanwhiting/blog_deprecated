      <description>Here are some notes on machine learning models.
Concepts Behind Decision Trees  Bagging (boostrap aggregation): Randomly sample with replacement, and average the results. Majority vote: The most commonly-occuring prediction. Internal node: Where the splits occur. Branches: Segments that connect the nodes. Terminal node (leafs, regions): Where the observations end up. The average of the responses (or majority vote) is the prediction for future observations. Gini index: where \(m\) is the leaf and \(k\) is the class (0 or 1 for binary classification, but can be extedned for multiple classes).</description>
