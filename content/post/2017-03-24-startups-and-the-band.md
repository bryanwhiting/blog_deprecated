# Similarities between starting a band and starting a company:

Startup | Band
---

Picking a CEO | picking a singer
Getting funding | record label
Key partnerships | touring with bigger bands
Nailing a niche | Finding the songs that people like
Beta testers | Early fanbase, hometown



Things to watch out for, if your'e a start up
* Don't be a one-hit-wonder
 - Palm pilot
 - AOL
 - Yahoo search
* Evolve your music with the times
 - Coldplay
 - Rolling Stones
 - red hot chili peppers
 - Your product needs to change with the times, as the company that stays in power is the one that keeps solving the problems of tomorrow. Tomorrow's problems are more important to tomorrow than today's solutions for today.
* Tastes change. Obsoletion happens.
 - The Sexton was a great tool for navigating the seas. But who knows how to use one today?
