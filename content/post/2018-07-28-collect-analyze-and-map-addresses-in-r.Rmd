```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=F)
# setwd("~/github/blog/content/post")
```

The goal of this tutorial is to do the following:

1. Collect addresses (via Google Forms)
2. Download to R (via `googlesheets`)
3. Geocode them (via `geocode`)
4. Plot them (using `leaflet`)
5. Get driving distance between them (via `gmapsdistance`)
6. Cluster them (`kmeans`)
7. Making the `leaflet` plot fancy

## 1. Collect
Perhaps in a future post I'll explore [googleformr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleformr/index.html). For now, I create forms the old-school way.

Create a Form:

1. Visit drive.google.com
2. Create a Form 
3. Collect responses (google a random "fake address generator" for inspiration)
4. Save the responses to a new sheet `fake_addresses`

Steps in pretty picture form:

## 2. Connect and Download

I use the [googlesheets](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googlesheets/index.html) API to connect to the google sheet of choice.
[Tutorial](https://datascienceplus.com/how-to-use-googlesheets-to-connect-r-to-google-sheets/) for first-timers. Also, this [vignette](https://rawgit.com/jennybc/googlesheets/master/vignettes/basic-usage.html#get-a-google-sheet-to-practice-with)
.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("dkahle/ggmap") # for the register_google function
devtools::install_github("rodazuero/gmapsdistance")
install.load::install_load('gmapsdistance', 'googlesheets', 'dplyr', 'leaflet', 'magrittr', 'ggmap', 'cluster', 'factoextra')
```

Run this to authorize access to your Google account. It's pretty nice!
```{r sheets1, eval=FALSE}
gs_auth(new_user=TRUE)
```
Identify your sheet name and pull the data. Write to disk to save time in the future.
```{r sheets, eval=FALSE}
wb_name <- gs_title('fake_addresses')
# Or, if published to web, enter the key after /d/ in the url:
# wb_name <- gs_key('198ng981...')
wb <- gs_read(wb_name)
# Save it to csv (you could skip this)
wb %>% write.csv('data/20180720/addresses.csv')
```

Read it in, inspect, and clean.
```{r read}
wb <- read.csv('data/20180720/addresses.csv')
wb %<>% select(-X, -Timestamp)
colnames(wb) <- c('address', 'favorite_color', 'favorite_food')
wb$address %<>% as.character() # geocode requires a character, not level
wb %>% knitr::kable()
```

## 3. Geocode the addresses
To use the `geocode` funciton, you may need to create a google maps API if you over-do your quota (daily limit is 2500). See footnotes for API help.
```{r}
# load the googlemaps api
api_key = trimws(readChar('data/google_maps_api', 1000))
register_google(key = api_key)
substr(api_key, 1, 3)
```

Use `geocode()` for each address. (This code was taken from somewhere, though I can't remember where.)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
df <- wb
df$lon <- 0
df$lat <- 0
df$geoAddress <- ""

for(i in 1:nrow(df))
{
  if(!is.na(df$address[i])){
    result <- geocode(df$address[i], output = "latlona", source = "google")
    df$lon[i] <- as.numeric(result[1])
    df$lat[i] <- as.numeric(result[2])
    df$geoAddress[i] <- as.character(result[3])
  }
}
df %>% knitr::kable()
```
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# df %>% write.csv('data/20180720/addresses2.csv')
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv('data/20180720/addresses2.csv')
df %>% knitr::kable()
```

## 4. Plot in leaflet
Lets visualize our people using `leaflet`.
```{r}
leafMap <- df %>%
   leaflet() %>% 
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers(~lon, ~lat)
leafMap
```
We see we got one person all the way up in Troy.

## 5. Get driving distance between points
With `gmapsdistance` you can calculate the walking, driving, biking, and public transportation distance between two coordinates. (See [docs](https://github.com/rodazuero/gmapsdistance).)
```{r}
# This set.api.key is from gmapsdistance (as opposed to ggmap). You need to install the github version if you want `driving` to work as of this post. See https://github.com/rodazuero/gmapsdistance/issues/17
set.api.key(api_key)

# Get the distance between two locations
df %<>% mutate(latlon = paste(lat, '+', lon, sep = ''))
results = gmapsdistance(origin = df$latlon[1], destination = df$latlon[2], mode = 'driving', shape = 'long')
results
```
The results `Time` are the time in seconds it takes to go between the two points, and the `Distance` is in meters.

Now, if you want, you can use this to calculate the driving distance between all of your addresses. Or, use it to optimize a route. But we'll stop our use here. I just explored that for fun.

## 6. Clustering people on the map
Lets say you want to cluster your peoples into one of three groups. Pretty simple with `kmeans` clustering (or another clustering method).

```{r}
mat <- df %>% select(lat, lon) %>% as.matrix()
k <- kmeans(mat, centers=3)
df$k_clust <- k$cluster
df %>% select(lat, lon, k_clust) %>% knitr::kable()
```

Now lets see these clusters in a map.
```{r}
# Function to color
df$mcolor <- plyr::mapvalues(df$k_clust, from=c(1, 2, 3), 
                             to=c('blue', 'orange', 'green'))
# Create new markers
icons <- awesomeIcons(markerColor = df$mcolor)

leafMap <- df %>%
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addAwesomeMarkers(~lon, ~lat, icon=icons)
leafMap
```

## 7. Making the plot all fancy
I don't really like this default leaflet map, so lets up it. Also, lets visualize the favorite food and add some meaningful labels.

Changing the icons:
```{r}
df$icons <- plyr::mapvalues(df$favorite_food, from=c("Peanuts", "Salmon", "Caviar"), 
                             to=c('bus', 'bicycle', 'car'))

icons <- awesomeIcons(markerColor = df$mcolor, 
                      library = 'fa', #fontawesome (google the icons)
                      icon = df$icons)

df %>%
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addAwesomeMarkers(~lon, ~lat, icon=icons)
```

Changing the [basemap](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/basemaps.html) to make the colors 'pop' a little more:
```{r}
df %>%
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  addAwesomeMarkers(~lon, ~lat, icon=icons)
```
(Other basemap examples here: https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/)

Then, let's finish off with some pop-up labels (click to see the action):
```{r}
df %<>% mutate(
 popup = paste(sep = "<br/>", 
               paste("<b>Favorite Food:", favorite_food, "</b>"), 
               paste("Favorite Color:", favorite_color), 
               address)
)

df %>%
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  addAwesomeMarkers(~lon, ~lat, icon=icons,
                    label = ~address,
                    popup = ~popup) 
```

## Google maps API

You don't have to use the API if you have less than 2500 calls per day. But if you want ot use `geocode` and `gmapsdistnace`, you have to enable `Distance Matrix API` and `Geocoding API` on the Google Maps API. It's fairly easy: just create an account and find those two boxes to click.
