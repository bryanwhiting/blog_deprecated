What do products have in common with prediction models? They both solve problems, depend heavily on the samples in which they're trained, and should adapt as samples grow.

In modeling:
Bias: the mean difference between your estimate and the average of the truth.
Variance: the average squared difference from the truth.

In product development:
Bias: the distance between how your product solves a problem and how the "ideal" solution would look like
Variance: How each person's experience is with the product, and how well it solves the problem for them.

In product development, the problem is slightly different for everyone. The goal differs. Either create one product that solves one problem really well, or create a product with a lot of arms that solves a lot of problems less effectively (Excel).

In developing a product, you do the following:
1. Create an idea about a problem that needs to be solved
2. Build a product
1. Get beta testers, focus groups, surveys and see if yo

Your product success depends on your sample.

Suggestions fro product development:

* Get more variance in your beta testers.
* Bigger sample sizes let you know what problems actually exist out there.
