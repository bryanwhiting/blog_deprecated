Last March, I wanted to break into the Data Science community but was struggling with confidence and starting to doubt I'd make it. I had been reading blog after blog about data science, practiced additional coding and algorithms at night. Yet rejection after rejection, I started to doubt I'd make it. Now on the other side, something strange has happened - hindsight makes it all makes sense I write this post to my past self.

# The Crucial Epiphony
I remember reading [blog](https://medium.com/@datalab/how-to-break-into-the-data-science-market-f0e0b79b42f7), after [blog](http://brohrer.github.io/get_data_science_job.html), after [blog](https://tdhopper.com/blog/faq/) on how to get a job in data science. I started thinking that because I wasn't getting the 'job title' I wanted, that I somehow lacked in these things and that ultimately I should pursue another discipline. In hindsight, I realized two lessons along the way that clarifies the journey beautifully. 

First, there are three sources of bias in the data science recruiting world:

1. Every company has a different perception of a data scientist
2. Within each company, there are different definitions of a data scientist
3. Recruiters have a different perception of a data scientist than the data scientist hiring managers

These biases indeed interact and create a hot mess, which leads to the crucial second lesson: 

> find the data science job that _you_ want to be interviewed for.

The cruciality of this point might be lost in its simplicity. But the hiring process should reveal to you exactly what they're looking for. And if they're not testing you on what _you_ want to be tested on, take note.

# Discern what's being recruited

Every prospective data scientist should be _extremely_ careful in their recruiting, to the point that they know exactly who's hiring them and why. To some degree, if you know you have some DS chops, you should to a degree, be grateful you were rejected. 

The term Data Scientist is as general as saying 'Engineer'. If you're an engineer, are you a chemical, mechanical, civil, software, or a [maintence engineer](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=maintenance+engineer&l=90210)? Perhaps, you're a data engineer? And if you're a data engineer, are you just a data scientist at some other company? 

You've probably heard that there are a  [few](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/six-categories-of-data-scientists), [different](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/difference-between-machine-learning-data-science-ai-deep-learning), [subdivisions](https://www.dezyre.com/article/10-different-types-of-data-scientists/179) of a data scientist:

> statistician, economist (macroeconomic data), mathematician, data engineers, machine learning scientists, artificial intelligence (neural networks, reinforcement learning), actuarial scientist (risk), business analytic practitioners, software programming analysts, spatial data scientist (maps), interactive data visualization specialist, digital analytic consultant, quality analyst.

Until the industry hype dies down and refines its definitions for data scientist, it's essential that you define for yourself what each possible job responsibilities mean and that you clarify with the hiring managers that the skillset you want to be hired for is indeed the skillset they're recuriting for. To save time, do this upfront. But I also learned going through the data science interviews at Capital One that I found what I was looking for. Use the recruiting process to narrow the gap between what you want to be doing and what your employer wants you to do.


# Why I failed so many times

Each rejection brought valuable learnings. I'll share with you why I think I failed my previous interviews (with important takeaways in the footnotes):

1. In the coding portion, I didn't manipulate the data in the way they were expecting[^1]. 
2. I failed to maximize the efficiency of my for loop[^2]. 
3. It was decided that I would probably be better at a program manager position than a true data scientist[^3].
4. I had no idea how to back out the efficient sample size necessary to detect a significant difference between A/B populations[^4].
5. And after a final-round rejection, I followed up. I was told that I had all of the technical skills, but could work on my _confidence_.
6. A recruiter looked at my resume and told me I didn't have enough 'open-source' experience[^6]. (Check out the foonote.)

Recruiting is _very_ [hard to get right](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html). The important takeaway is not to take it personally if you get rejected. Sometimes rejection is a good thing. 

[^1]: I tried reshaping data rather than split-apply-combine. This may seem minor, but when you get stuck in an interiew there can be an awkward moment where you try to do it one way and the recruiter might not know your approach. If they can't guide you, you appear incompetant. This can often happen if I have an R background and my recruiter comes from a SQL background.
[^2]: Despite realizing 10 minutes after the interview my error and emailing the recruiter the true solution. This highlights a key point: are you looking for a software engineer, a data manipulator, or a statistician? 
[^3]: I feel like this happened because I was being quizzed by many computer scientists-turned-data scientists. I was asked a lot of machine learning questsions that I couldn't answer, yet I knew a ton of regression and statistical knowlege. So at the same time I made it to the final round of a separate tech company for knowing a ton of stats, I failed this interview for not knowing my machine learning well enough.
[^4]: After the interview, I realized this was a simple t-test that I could have googled stack overflow for. But I'm sure they were looking for someone more immediately proficient in those techniques, which I was not. 
[^5]: You know how interviewers 'like to hear how you think' while trying to solve a problem. Although I arrived at the correct answers, perhaps I was a bit waffly in my attempts to explain my reasoning. In hindsight: don't relate your doubts. Just relate your knowledge. I'm also more of a pensive, meditative thinker, so I might not do as well as the smooth thinkers. 
[^6]: I reviewed my resume and I had five references to R, three to Python, and _one_ to SAS, and a few to Stata, Matlab, etc. Of course, SAS stands out beause it has three capital letters over one: R.) There are some lessons here: 1) your recruiter might think there's a difference between a forecast and a prediction, or a random forest and a decision tree. 2) Perhaps it's better to generalize your technique so recruiters can understand it, and the specify your technique so data scientists hiring managers can comprehend. E.g.: I specialize in decision tree methods (GBMs). 3) Only put on your resume things you want to do in your job.

# My Journey to the Epiphony

TODO: Edit this conversation surrounding how I got the job, how I succeeded: doing what I knew I could do. Point: there's a job out there that wants you for who you are. Find it.

Full disclaimer: I have a B.S. and M.S.in Statitics, so I wasn't exactly starting from scratch. 

I've interviewed at the following jobs (some of them was just one interview, others made it to the final round.)

Some were looking for the analyatics data scientist. Some were looking for the software engineer or the data engineer. Some were probably looking for my skillset and maybe I just hit the anti-loop.

Microsoft, Apple, Walmart, Amazon, Indeed, Facebook, Intuit, Capital One, LinkedIn, Goldman Sachs, Qualtrics, Domo, Adobe, KPMG, PWC, Vivint,  

Startups: StackRox, Copernicus and JCC Bowers

Previously, I was contacted by recruiters 3-4 times over a 21 month window while working in 'Legal Services' consulting (doing not quite data science, but fairly close). Since joining Capital One as a 'Data Scientist' just 11 months ago, I've been contacted at least 15 times, and some times 3-4 times a month. I've been contacted by big and small, tech and non-tech alike. What does this show: there's _hype_ around the word data scientist[^7]. And it might make you (and my manager) wonder why I'm still at Capital One (read on!).

[^7]: Of course, I prefer that hype to what I had before. But again, few of these jobs have related to my area of expertise. So while a recruiter likes my profile, the hiring manager might find me ill qualified.

# What's _my_ definition of a data scientist?

I've heard recruiters laud how they work on 'petabytes' of data. Yet when asking individual employees, you learn that it was just one job they did several years ago, and now they work mostly on small data. (Again, kindly grill your prospective employer.) To settle the dust, here's the type of data science work I do.

More generally:

1. Help solve an incredibly strategic business initiative
1. Build a machine learning model that will score customer behavior in real time
1. Impact millions of customers

More specifically:

1. Write PySpark queries to clean, append and join, nine different data sources. (One of those data sources are 170 million rows, others are less. After cleaning and compressing, it's around 30GB of data.)
1. Build AWS EMR/EC2 environments to pull data from Redshift/S3 into the data engineering pipeline.
1. Train a Gradient Boosted Machine using [H2O in python](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/gbm.html) 

And it continues to satisfy my big three I had during my interview process:

1. Work on really challenging problems
2. Build data products (models, visualizations, etc.)
3. Work with collaborative, amiable colleages

I love Capital One because (for reasons unknown to me), they've trusted my team with an extremely complex and high-valued initiative. When I first joined, I noticed that the other data scientists around me were solving similarly ambitious initiatives. It's a company that has the potential to do a lot of good in the world.

# Conclusion

I interviewed with a lot of companies, but when I found Capital One I was happy that their definition of a data scientist matched my own. If you have the skills, be confident in those skills and what you have to offer.

So remember: discern the bias, know your skillset, and find the data science job that you want to be hired for. 

Lastly, if you're a data scientist and Capital One sounds like what you're looking for, please reach out to me!



# OLD NOTES
1. Every company has a different definition of data scientist. So the tests are different. 
2. Even within a company, the term data scientist is used from those who do less quant business analytics to machine learning. 
3. Leverage the recruiter
4. Just because you don't pass one company, doesn't mean you won't pass another

Every company has a different definition as a data scientist. 

There's your analytics specialist. 
I have a friend working at a notable tech company. Their 200 person data science team consists of VBA developers that automate the production of reports, statistical researchers who use R to deliver in depth analytics, machine learning specialists who develop algorithms (not so much research) and people who don't know a thing about coding but help manage clients (perhaps the title data scientist is just for marketing reasons).

Look at Uber's website - the company that has the most number of data scientist openings I could find. The requirements range from having a PhD in astrophysics to being someone who can only do a simple SQL query but loves diving into data problems. That's quite a disparate field. How do you know where you fit in?
