      <description>I believe that each creation has four phases: dreaming, planning, acting, and reflecting. Think about it - is there anything you&amp;rsquo;ve ever made that didn&amp;rsquo;t first enter into your mind, you came up with some game plan, you carried it out, and then when you were done you could see what went well and where you improved? Isn&amp;rsquo;t this what scrums are really about?
I wanted a scrum for my personal life, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find it practical to use the many online resources available.</description>

      <description>This blog will outline what I see as differences between Hugo and Jekyll, some benefits and drawbacks of using Netlify vs. GitHub pages to host, and how to launch the Hugo Tranquilpeak theme from scratch.
Why Hugo? One of my first posts was about blogging with Jekyll hosted on GitHub. About six months after writing that post, I hit a few bugs trying to debug it and got frustrated because I had already forgotten all of what I binge-learned earlier.</description>
