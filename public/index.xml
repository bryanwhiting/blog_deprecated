      <description>Some projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on. Some are complete, some are in progress. If it&amp;rsquo;s research, I say whether it&amp;rsquo;s complete or not. If it&amp;rsquo;s a product, I say that it&amp;rsquo;s either &amp;ldquo;In development&amp;rdquo; or in &amp;ldquo;beta&amp;rdquo;.
   Project Description Type/Status     LDS conference analytics dashboard An R Shiny tool to analyze word frequencies and trends for the semi-annual LDS General Conference talks In development   Comparing GLMs, hurdle models, and zero-inflated models to detect discrepancies in banking overdrafts A regulatory framework to detect behavioral differences in overdraft fees between low-income and high-income users Complete   the garden A meditative planning tool Beta    </description>

      <title>Why I Write</title>

      <description>I want to share. And I believe that writing is a process where scrambled thoughts can be converted into shareable information.
In math, processes are called functions. In writing, my thoughts are the inputs, writing is the function, and this post is my output. In statistics, the truth is unattainable, only estimable. Writing is the function that uses my thoughts to estimate truth. And bias is the distance from the truth.</description>

      <title>Yet Another Weekly Planner</title>

      <description>I believe that each creation has four phases: dreaming, planning, acting, and reflecting. Think about it - is there anything you&amp;rsquo;ve ever made that didn&amp;rsquo;t first enter into your mind, you came up with some game plan, you carried it out, and then when you were done you could see what went well and where you improved? Isn&amp;rsquo;t this what scrums are really about?
I wanted a scrum for my personal life, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t find it practical to use the many online resources available.</description>

      <title>Blogdown and Tranquilpeak Hosted on Netlify: a Deep Dive</title>

      <description>This blog will outline what I see as differences between Hugo and Jekyll, some benefits and drawbacks of using Netlify vs. GitHub pages to host, and how to launch the Hugo Tranquilpeak theme from scratch.
Why Hugo? One of my first posts was about blogging with Jekyll hosted on GitHub. About six months after writing that post, I hit a few bugs trying to debug it and got frustrated because I had already forgotten all of what I binge-learned earlier.</description>

      <title>The DataViz battle: Plotly vs ggplot2</title>
      <link>/2017/02/the-dataviz-battle-plotly-vs-ggplot2/</link>

      <guid>/2017/02/the-dataviz-battle-plotly-vs-ggplot2/</guid>
      <description>R users fall in love with ggplot2, the growing standard for data visualization in R. The ability to quickly vizualize trends, and customize just about anything youâ€™d want, make it a powerful tool. Yet this week, I made a discvoery that may reduce how much I used ggplot2. Enter plot_ly().
For this post, I assume that you have a working knowledge of the dplyr (or magrittr) and ggplot2 packages.</description>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use the shell/terminal/command line, you should. Why? Here&amp;rsquo;s a sampling of I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the last month:
 I used R to generate 30,000 plots using ggplot(). I used the shell and ffmpeg to animate those plots as a movie. I&amp;rsquo;ve used the shell from VBA to send an Excel column of data into Stata, execute a summary statistic command, and then import the results back into Excel.</description>

      <description>Hello world.
I wanted to start a blog. I wanted to set it up for free, use a custom URL (and not something.bloggingplatform.com), and be able to both blog and create tutorials. I didn&amp;rsquo;t mind it possibly being technical1. Enter Jekyll.
If you want to get your blog in 10 minutes, skip to below.
Why Blog with Jekyll? Here&amp;rsquo;s why you can and should blog with Jekyll (if you&amp;rsquo;re a data scientist):</description>
