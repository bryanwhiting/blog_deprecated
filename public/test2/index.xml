      <description>Why I write I want to share. And I believe that writing is a process where scrambled thoughts can be converted into shareable information.
In math, processes are called functions. In writing, my thoughts are the inputs, writing is the function, and this post is my output. In statistics, the truth is unattainable, only estimable. Writing is the function that uses my thoughts to estimate truth. And bias is the distance from the truth.</description>
